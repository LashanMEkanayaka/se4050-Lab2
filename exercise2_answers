1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

As the number of hidden nodes increases, the neural network gains more capacity to learn complex patterns and decision boundaries from the data. 
This can lead to improved accuracy on the training data, as the model becomes more flexible.

2.Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

The accuracy typically follows a pattern: initially, it increases as the model gains capacity to fit the data (moving from underfitting). 
It then reaches an optimal point where the model generalizes well. 
Beyond this point, increasing hidden nodes can lead to overfitting, where the model learns noise in the training data, potentially causing its performance on unseen data to degrade, even if training accuracy remains high.
